title: 'My New Nextjs Portfolio Site!'

I'm excited to create my website in Next.js and utilizing the amazing ecosystem that it offers. The two forms of pre-rendering offered includes static generation and server-side generation. It permits the selection of how you want to render each page. That's helpful because I would have to redeploy my previous Gatsby site everytime I make a change.

Another feature I'm excited about is writing my blog posts in markdown and having them convert right to HTML! I use to love writing on previous blog about travel and web development but I did not like the separation of responsibilities to my CMS. With including markdown files right into the Github repository, I know all my data is all in one spot and more antifragile against new CMS updates that could increase my personal technical debt.

Thanks for coming by and I hope to contribute more posts soon!
